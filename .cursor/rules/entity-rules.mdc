# Entity and Model Implementation Standards

These rules govern how entities and models should be structured and organized within the project.

## Structure and Organization

* **File Location:** All entities/models should be placed in the `entities/` directory.
* **File Naming:** Entity files should use snake_case (e.g., `user_account.py`, `order_item.py`).
* **File Structure:** Each entity should have its own dedicated file.

## Implementation Requirements

* **Class-Based Definition:** All entities/models should be defined and initialized as proper classes.
* **Programming Language:** All entity/model code should be written in Python.
